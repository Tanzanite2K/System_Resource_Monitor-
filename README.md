# System_Resource_Monitor
This project is a real-time system resource monitoring tool developed in Python, designed to track and log key performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and network activity. By leveraging the psutil library for system data collection and matplotlib for data visualization, the tool provides users with both live statistics and historical trend analysis through dynamic graphs. Logged data is stored in a CSV file, enabling further inspection or reporting. This tool is especially useful for system administrators, developers, or anyone interested in analyzing how their system resources are being utilized over time.
